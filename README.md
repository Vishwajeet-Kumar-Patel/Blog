<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

1. Profile Enhancements: Allow users to update additional profile information (e.g. bio social media links). Add a profile page where users can view their own posts and profile information.
2. Image and Media Management: Implement an image gallery for users to manage their uploaded images. Allow users to embed videos and other media in their posts.
3. Notifications: Add a notification system to alert users of new comments likes or replies to their posts. Implement email notifications for important events (e.g. new comments new followers).
4. Performance Optimization: Optimize the backend queries to improve performance. Implement caching strategies to reduce load times.
5. Security Enhancements: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API. Add CSRF protection for forms. Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
